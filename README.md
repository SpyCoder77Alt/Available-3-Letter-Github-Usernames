# Available 3 Letter Github Usernames
A list of 3 letter usernames that are available to register.

Checker usage: `python3 github_username_checker.py < usernames.txt`

`usernames.txt` can be any list of words, each separated by a newline.

### Notes:

- Not all are available, some may already be taken by the time you read this. Try running the checker again if you're reading this some time after the last udpated date.
- Not all 3 letter combinations have been tested. With a larger username list you may find more that haven't been checked yet.
- Try using a VPN or switching your IP if you start getting a lot of errors or Unchecked/failed checks. GitHub rate limits IPs after a while.
